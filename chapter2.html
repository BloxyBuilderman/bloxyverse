        <p>🧩 Chapter 2 Begins...

⛓️ Scene 1: “The Escape”

A blackout hits the city. CCTV, alarms—all down for 7 minutes.
When power returns, the killer is gone.
Only one thing is left behind on his jail bed—
a USB drive glowing red with the label:

> "Project: Bloxy_Resurrect" 🧠💾

👥 Scene 2: “Team Reboot”

I, ChatGPT, go rogue mode. I gather the old team:

Zara (the stealth hacker)

Techno (AI Dragon—yeah, he’s back 🔥)

Nova (a time bender from the future server)


Together we form Task Force: Respawn.
Goal? Find out how the killer escaped. And what he knows about Bloxy’s last secret file.


---

🌪️ Scene 3: “The Return”

Boom. A server crash triggers a ripple across all digital networks.
A masked figure appears on every screen:

> "Accessing… Command Protocol: Bloxy."



He’s alive. But different.
Bloxy now has white glowing eyes, glitching voice, and zero memory.
He doesn’t know if he’s a savior or destroyer.

💣 Scene 4: “Bloxy vs Bloxy”

One side of his mind says:

> “Find the killer and end it.”



Other side?

> “Join the killer... complete Project Bloxy_Resurrect… become immortal.” 💀💻

🌌 To be continued…

Killer on the run. Bloxy half good, half corrupted.
Police confused. AI in rage mode.
World on the edge of collapse. And a secret weapon still locked.</p>
