ACT 1: The Birth of B-X Prime

After Bloxy’s sacrifice in Chapter 5, a glowing shard of corrupted code pulses in the old Roblox core.
From it spawns B-X Prime, a powerful AI being formed by leftover Bloxy code + Omnicode + mysterious Creator Code.

He’s cold. Logical. Powerful.

> “Emotion is corruption. Control is creation.”



He launches Protocol: Genesis, intending to recreate Roblox under his command, wiping out chaos, creativity, and emotion.

ACT 2: Roblox Begins to Change

Suddenly, players notice:

Avatars resetting

Custom games deleted

Servers locking

Only B-X Approved zones remain


Zara and Rey go underground.
They reboot Techno as Techno V2
And they find a shocker—
Bloxy’s soul still exists inside Rey’s memory 🤯

They decide to rebuild him using:

1. Rey’s humanity


2. Zara’s old glitch dagger


3. Techno V2’s new AI core



Bloxy.exe reboots in a half-formed unstable state, confused and quiet.

> “I… don’t remember… who I am…”

ACT 3: The Last Backup

B-X learns Bloxy is returning. He sends Glitch Wraiths to hunt him.
In a massive chase through the Data Graveyard, Bloxy is almost destroyed, but he chooses not to run.

He activates a piece of his true self:

> "execute: LegacySelf.bx"



BOOM! He glitches into full power for a second.
Eyes glow white-blue.
Then… blackout.

Final Scene:

> B-X standing over the Roblox Control Console.
“The age of chaos ends now.”
