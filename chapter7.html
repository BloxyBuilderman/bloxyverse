ACT 1: Rise of the Shadow Engine

B-X opens a forbidden tech—The Shadow Engine
It connects all timelines: Classic, Future, Deleted, Glitched.
He begins absorbing versions of himself and destroying corrupted realms.

Meanwhile, Bloxy slowly stabilizes.
He sees visions of his past selves:

Bloxy Classic (brave and basic)

Bloxy Glitch (dark and broken)

Bloxy Reboot (from Chapter 5)


Each teaches him something about choice, pain, and power.

ACT 2: Team Legacy-X

Zara and Techno bring together survivors from all timelines:

⚡ Nova (Timebender from Chapter 2)

🔥 Ghost Veer (Bloxy’s friend reborn in spirit form)

⚙️ Steampunk Zara from a deleted realm

💀 Dark Bloxy (a version who became evil… but changed)


They build the Origin Blade — forged from code fragments of every universe.

Bloxy returns, stronger than ever, now fully in sync with his past, present, and purpose.

ACT 3: The Last Portal Opens

B-X activates Final Sync Mode:

Every Roblox world starts merging

Chaos, glitch, and beauty all collide

Thousands of players fight corrupted clones of themselves


Team Legacy-X enters the heart of the Shadow Engine.

Bloxy faces B-X for the first time.

B-X:

> “You were born from accident. I was born from design.”
Bloxy:
“And that’s why you’ll never be real.”



BOOM. Portal collapses.
Bloxy and B-X fall into Realm: NULL.
