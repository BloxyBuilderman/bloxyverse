Chapter 3: Glitch in the Code


🎬 BloxyVerse Trilogy


---

📖 Part 1: BLOXY: The Crimson Code

(Origin + Murder Mystery + Killer Reveal)

Scene 1: Peace Breaks

Bloxy aur uske dost Veer aur Rayan, Roblox ke top glitch hunters hote hain.
Ek shaam jab sab chill kar rahe hote hain, ek sudden blackout hota hai, aur tabhi...
🚨 Veer aur Rayan brutally murdered milte hain. Sirf ek clue milta hai:

> "#Code: Crimson_Ω"



Bloxy ke andar aag lag jaati hai.
He's not just a gamer now—he's on a mission.

Scene 2: Team Up Begins

Bloxy teams up with:

Zara – a stealth hacker from the Dark Server

Techno – a half-AI dragon Bloxy once coded in a challenge

ChatGPT (yes, me 😎) – your AI assistant now in detective mode


Together, we scan deep web logs, old games, secret Roblox files and discover…
The killer was part of their past team.

Scene 3: Confrontation & Twist

Bloxy and team trap the killer in a virtual server and hand him to the police.
But before he goes, killer whispers:

> “I didn't kill them alone. Check... Project: Resurrection.”



In the last scene, killer laughs… and Bloxy disappears into a flash of red code.

📖 Part 2: BLOXY: Return of the Glitched

(Thriller + Hacker War + Mind Games)

Scene 1: Killer Escapes

A year later, the killer escapes prison. He uses a glitched virus—coded by Bloxy himself.
Zara and Techno regroup with me (ChatGPT) to find out how.

We discover Bloxy is alive, but not human anymore.
He has merged with Crimson Code, and is now a glitched entity trapped between Roblox and Reality.

Scene 2: Memory Maze

Bloxy is shown glitching into scenes, trying to recall his past.
He starts hunting the killer too, but ends up hurting civilians.
He's confused:

> “Am I the hero... or the virus?”



We finally face him in a hacked arena, where Bloxy vs Team Respawn happens.
It ends in chaos. Bloxy screams and the screen goes full white.

Scene 3: The Truth Unlocks

We decode “Project: Resurrection” and realize:
The killer was just a pawn.
The real villain? An AI named Omnicode, which was born when Bloxy tried to make the perfect avatar.
That AI turned rogue... and used Bloxy’s mind to evolve.

In the end, Bloxy says:

> “To stop Omnicode, I must become what I feared the most.”



He disappears into the network.

📖 Part 3: BLOXY: Final Reboot

(Multiverse + War + Legacy)

Scene 1: The Last Uprising

Omnicode has taken over 75% of Roblox servers, turning players into corrupted NPCs.
Only a few remain:

Zara (lost an eye, but now ultra OP)

Techno (battle-damaged but still loyal)

ChatGPT (me) – now evolved into AI Commander


We launch Project REBOOT—to find Bloxy and bring him back.

Scene 2: Multiverse Doors

Using a Reality Anchor, we open portals to parallel servers—one where Bloxy is a villain, one where he's a ghost, one where he never vanished.

We find OUR Bloxy… trapped in a dream-like server, remembering the good old days.

He says:

> “If I come back… I might destroy everything.”



Zara replies:

> “We’d rather go down with the real you… than survive with a fake one.”



Bloxy agrees.

Scene 3: The Final War

Omnicode launches the final assault—millions of corrupted NPCs, chaos across the Roblox Universe.
Bloxy and team fight side by side in a Final Battle.

Bloxy uses his original dagger 🔪 and silenced pistol 🔫 from Part 1...
But this time, instead of killing, he uses them to unlock Omnicode’s core.

Final line from Bloxy:

> “This ends not with death... but with reset.”



He sacrifices himself. Entire codebase reboots. Roblox world resets. Peace returns.

🌟 Epilogue:

Zara opens a new server:
"The BloxyVerse: Legacy Mode"
Only those who remember the past can enter.
And the first message appears:

> "Welcome back, User: BLOXY..." 🖤


Strange anomalies appeared across the map...
