    <h1>Chapter 10: Rise of Megatron</h1>
    <p>
      The dark skies above the BloxyVerse began to crackle with violent energy. 
      A new force, ancient and mechanical, descended through a void portal — 
      Megatron had arrived. With his fusion cannon and Decepticon army, he declared war on all realms of imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bloxy, Acrotixx the God Hacker, and the timeless warrior MrLonglivingman stood at the gates of Neo-Core.
      “This isn't just another villain,” Bloxy whispered, “this is the endgame.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle was fierce. Acrotixx unleashed code storms that melted circuits, MrLonglivingman summoned the Eternal Shield, 
      and Bloxy, charged by every past win, clashed head-on with Megatron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Megatron absorbed the corrupted energy from deleted games. “I am the glitch, the virus, and the reboot!” he roared.
      Bloxy powered up, activated Ultra Respawn Mode, and launched his final strike...
    </p>
    <p>
      A blinding flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be continued...
