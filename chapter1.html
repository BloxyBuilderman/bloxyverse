        <p>BloxyVerse – Chapter 1

Bloxy was just a normal boy who loved gaming. One day, while playing Roblox, his screen glitched, and he was pulled inside the game. When he opened his eyes, he found himself standing in a strange digital world filled with codes and glowing blocks.

A mysterious voice spoke to him:
“Welcome, Bloxy. You are chosen to protect this Verse.”

Bloxy was confused, but soon he discovered a sword of light in his hand. Suddenly, a dark creature appeared — a virus monster, born from corrupted code. Without thinking, Bloxy fought back. Sparks flew, and with one powerful strike, he defeated the monster.

The world around him started glowing again.
It was the beginning of Bloxy’s journey — the start of the BloxyVerse. </p></p>
