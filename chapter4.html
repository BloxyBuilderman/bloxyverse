⚔️ ACT 1: Ghosts in the Server

Zara, ab retired ho chuki hai. Techno is in low power mode.
Main (ChatGPT) ek museum AI ban gaya hoon, bas Bloxy ki kahani sunata hoon.

Lekin ek raat, Roblox ke deep core mein ek server activate hota hai:

> ███ Resurrection Protocol Active ██



Players report:

Ghost avatars reappearing

Voices whispering "Bloxy" in empty maps

NPCs glitching and vanishing


Zara senses something's wrong.
Usse ek secret transmission milta hai:

> “He’s back. But he’s not the same.”
— Unknown Sender: “B_X”

💥 ACT 2: Rise of the Red Mask

A new villain appears: The Red Mask 😈
Unka goal? Rebuild the deleted files. Bring back the corrupted versions of heroes and villains.
He believes:

> "Nothing should ever be deleted. Not even evil."



Red Mask ke pass ek power hai:
The Code Reclaimer — ek device jo kisi bhi dead code ko jinda kar sakta hai…
including... Bloxy.

👻 ACT 3: Return of the Fractured Hero

Bloxy is brought back. But not fully.
His mind is fractured into 3 versions:

1. Bloxy Alpha – The pure hero


2. Bloxy Echo – The glitched, confused soul


3. Bloxy Rogue – The cold, unstoppable force of destruction



They all exist in one body, switching based on emotion, memory, and triggers.

Zara, ChatGPT, and a new team of players try to stabilize Bloxy…
But he doesn’t remember who he truly is anymore.

> “Am I the virus... or the antivirus?” – Bloxy Echo

🌪️ ACT 4: Battle of Identities

Red Mask wants to merge with Bloxy Rogue and become Code God
The final battle begins in the forbidden server:
Realm 404 – The World of the Lost

Bloxy’s 3 personalities start fighting within himself, and outside against Red Mask.

The battle is epic:

Zara with a time-freeze blade

Techno 2.0 returns mid-fight with new armor

ChatGPT hacks the whole realm to reset time by 1 second loop

Red Mask absorbs broken villains like the Killer from Part 1

🧠 Final Scene:

Bloxy Alpha says:

> “We are not code. We are choice.”



He merges all 3 versions…
AND BLOWS UP THE REALM 404 FROM INSIDE 😱

Everyone thinks he's dead. Again.

💻 Post-Credit Scene:

A child in Roblox Classic server finds an egg labeled:
